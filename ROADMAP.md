# TinyDispatcher Roadmap

This document outlines the current direction of the project.
It is intentionally short and focused.

TinyDispatcher prioritizes architectural clarity, performance, and predictability over feature expansion.

---

## Current Phase (Post 1.0 Stabilization)

Focus: Internal quality hardening.

- Increase test coverage
- Expand concurrency validation scenarios
- Strengthen source generator diagnostics
- Refactor internal components for clarity
- Remove legacy artifacts
- Improve documentation where it adds clarity

No new features planned in this phase.

---

## Short-Term Goals

- Improve generator diagnostics (clear compile-time errors)
- Improve middleware shape validation
- Expand integration samples (Azure functions, Worker Service)
- Benchmark suite documentation refresh

---

## Long-Term Direction

TinyDispatcher aims to remain:

- Minimal
- Predictable
- Allocation-conscious
- Explicit over magical


The goal is to stay small, sharp, and intentional.
